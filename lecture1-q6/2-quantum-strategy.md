For the regular coin toss we do use the Hadamard gate. It does put the qubit that was in the base state 0 in an equal superposition of states 1 and 0. So an interesting strategy would be to to the reverse operation. Set the initial state to that superposition and then apply the hadamard gate. If the PC is picking 0 as a result for example we can set the initial state to [-1/np.sqrt(2), -1/np.sqrt(2)] and when measured this will always read 0.
